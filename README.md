# Space Invaders, but it is a dinosaur
*By Eva Despinoy and Vilma Jalava*

We will create our version of the classic space invaders game.
The game will be played in the terminal, and we will probably use graphics that we will find online for the aliens and ships.
This is preliminary, as we maybe will change things over the course of the project.

## How to run from terminal

* Go into the project map. 
* Run `python3 hello.py` 

## Rules

* You win if you shoot 3 meteors
* You lose if you lose 5 pts as such: -1 if meteor hits ground, -2 if meteor hits dinosaur

If you win, the game will increasingly get harder.
